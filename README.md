Demo how to use Autolayout to make varying row height

See the post here [iOS dynamic table view cells with varying row height and Autolayout](http://www.fantageek.com/1468/ios-dynamic-table-view-cells-with-varying-row-height-and-autolayout/)

rhtech: Demo using multiple IB cells with different layouts that map onto the same cell class. It's a very simple demo that
shows how IB based constraints can behave transparently and independently of the underlying class. Good cell layouts
can save a lot of code. Notice the constraints within the cells; they're modified versions of the originals.
